Trying to figure out Github Pages x Jekyll.
Guess I'm going to use this to put all my docs.

What I learned so far:

Github Pages
1. For Account - you can only have 1
2. For Projects - you can have unlimited
3. You really can get started with a readme and a _config.yml for a single page Pages

To utilize other themes will need to use Jekyll.
